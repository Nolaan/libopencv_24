TODO : code optimisation to detect the face

FILES :

qt-facetrainer is a program that recognize faces after training. I'm currently trying to port it to the RPi

qt-facetrainer-cam     : Compiled version to display camera
qt-facetrainer-video   : Compiled version to display video
qt-facetrainer-x64     : Compiled version for desktop tests

Nota : Those programs work with OpenCV 2.4.9
