Compiled OpenCv 2.4 Librairies for Raspberry Pi

Tip : Use tags to choose prefered version ( distribution started at v2.4.9 )

I would suggest to put those files in /usr/local/lib to avoid your package manager erasing them.
(sudo cp -P * libopencv_* /usr/local/lib/)

Doing so you'll have to put this line in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/opencv.conf (create it!)

/usr/local/lib

And execute : sudo ldconfig
Now your apps know where to find those libs.
